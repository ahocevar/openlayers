title: NDVI+NDWI from two 16-bit COGs
shortdesc: Calculating NDVI+NDWI as green and blue values.
docs: >
  The GeoTIFF layer in this example calculates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
  and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from two cloud-optimized Sentinel 2 GeoTIFFs: one
  with 10 m resolution and red and a near infrared bands, and one with 60 m resolution and a short
  wave infrared channel. The NDVI is shown as green, the NDWI as blue.
